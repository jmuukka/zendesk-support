# Zendesk Support API

Zendesk Support API is provided by Zendesk. See https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/support/introduction

This package contains limited features of Zendesk Support API, implemented in F#. The initial goal for this package is to support features that my Zendesk-Severa Integration will need.
